# 🩺 Integrated Hospice Care System

> “How might we design an integrated IoT system to improve hospice care?”

This was a group project for our **Engineering Exploration module (Year 1 Sem 2)** at NYP, created by [Min](https://github.com/myriosMin), [Habib](#), [Alex](#), and [Jin Bin](#).  
The aim: build a responsive IoT system that brings **safety, comfort, and dignity** to elderly hospice patients.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This system is divided into **3 main units**:

1. **Environmental Monitoring** (temp, humidity, TVOC)
2. **Health Monitoring** (SpO₂, pulse, temperature)
3. **Safety Monitoring** (fall detection, toilet access, wet floor)

All three units are powered by **M5Stack Fire**, interconnected with **MQTT**, and upload live data to **Qubitro Cloud** for visualization.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- ⚙️ Smart temperature/humidity/air quality alerts
- 🧠 Real-time vital sign tracking
- 🚨 Fall detection system with countdown + alarm
- 🪪 RFID-based toilet access
- 💬 Gesture-based emergency alert
- 📊 Qubitro-powered dashboards
- 📡 MQTT interconnectivity between units

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🧱 Hardware Requirements

To replicate this project, you'll need the following components:

- `3×` M5Stack Fire core units  
- `1×` ENV III Unit (temperature & humidity)  
- `1×` TVOC/eCO2 Unit (air quality)  
- `1×` Earth Unit (wet floor detection)  
- `1×` Mini Heart Rate Unit  
- `1×` NCIR 2 Unit (IR body temperature)  
- `1×` Gesture Sensor  
- `1×` RFID Unit  
- `3×` Micro Servo Motors  
- USB-C cables, breadboard, and jumper wires (for optional testing and prototyping)

**Environmental Fire unit** is connected with ENV III and TVOC/eCO2 sensors, and a servo motor.
**Health Fire unit** is connected with Heart Rate and NCIR 2 sensors, and a servo motor.
**Safety Fire unit** is connected with Gesture sensor, RFID unit and a servo motor.

### 💻 Software Setup (MicroPython via UIFlow)

All units were programmed using **M5Stack UIFlow**, which uses **MicroPython**.

#### 📅 Required Imports
The following modules and libraries were used (usually already imported in UIFlow):

```python
from m5stack import *
from m5ui import *
from uiflow import *
import wifiCfg
from m5mqtt import M5mqtt
from libs.json_py import *
import unit
```

#### 🚀 Getting Started with UIFlow
1. Go to [https://flow.m5stack.com](https://flow.m5stack.com)  
2. Connect your M5Stack Fire device via WiFi
3. Flash the UIFlow firmware onto your device (if not already done)  
4. Use the UI editor to add sensors/units, or switch to code view to write MicroPython manually  
5. Ensure WiFi is configured using `wifiCfg` to enable MQTT connectivity

### ☁️ Cloud Dashboard with Qubitro

We used [**Qubitro**](https://qubitro.com) for real-time cloud data visualization and MQTT communication.

#### 🔧 Steps to Set Up:
1. Create an account at [qubitro.com](https://qubitro.com)  
2. Create 3 devices (one per unit: Environment, Health, Safety)  
3. Generate MQTT credentials (server, port, username, password, topic)  
4. Add the credentials in each unit's MicroPython code

#### 🧪 Sample MQTT Setup:
```python
m5mqtt = M5mqtt("unit_1", "mqtt.qubitro.com", 1883, "your_username", "your_password", 300)
m5mqtt.start()
```

Each unit sends data every few seconds to Qubitro, where real-time dashboards and graphs can be built easily.

### 🧠 Tips & Troubleshooting

- Use the UIFlow Unit test tool to confirm sensor communication before full integration  
- If a sensor isn’t working, check its **I2C address** and wiring  
- Some sensors may need **sensitivity adjustment** or slight physical tuning  
- MQTT errors? Double-check your **Qubitro credentials** and network connection  
- For multi-unit communication, ensure **unique MQTT topics** are used to prevent message overlap
